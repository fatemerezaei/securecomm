\subsection{Synchronization Messages}
These messages are aimed at keeping \bc peers
synchronized with the rest of the \bc network. 

\code{\textbf{addr:}}Each peer advertises the information and IP addresses of other peers via \code{\textbf{addr}} message in the network. \code{addr} message contains count and list of other peers IP addresses. Each IP address is accompanied by a timestamp showing its freshness. When a peer receives a list of addresses from other peers, it has a choice to forward any number of them. The peer chooses the sending addresses based on the following criteria: 1)~The number of IP addresses in the received message should not be greater than 10,and 2)~The timestamps should not be older than 10 minutes. This mechanism is applied for helping in peer discovery. 

\code{\textbf{inventory(inv):}} Peers send \code{inv} to advertise their knowledge about the known objects, like transactions and blocks. Each \code{inv} message consist of number of inventory entries and the inventory vectors itself. It can be received unsolicited, or in reply to \code{getblocks}.
Inventory vectors  are used for notifying other nodes about objects they have or data which is being requested. Inventory vectors consist of the type of objects and the hash of the object. 

\code{\textbf{getdata:}} A peer sends \code{getdata} message in response to the \code{inv} to retrieve information about the content of an object. This object could be a block or a transaction. 

\code{\textbf{tx}:} This message describes a bitcoin transaction in response to a \code{getdata} message. Each transaction is stored in a memory pool. If a received transaction is already in the pool, or it is included in one of the blocks in the main block-chain, it get discarded. 

% then the receiving peer runs several checks on the transaction's advertisement. If the checks passed, then the receiving peer asks for the transactions.

\subsection{Block-Related Messages} Such messages are used to exchange \bc blocks among the peers. 
The current \bc network is supporting two ways of propagating blocks, full block and compact block
propagation. Figure~\ref{fig:protocol-flow} demonstrates the flow of message communication in these
two ways.

\label{fig:protocol-flow}
\end{figure}


\paragraphe{Full Block Propagation:} The sender node first validate the block completely, then it advertise the possession of block by \code{inv} message. The receiving peer which doesn't have the block, asks for it by sending \code{getdata} message. Finally, the sender node send the block via \code{block} message. Sending full block in the network is wasting network bandwidth since we are re-sending all of the transaction and nodes have some of transaction in their memory pool. The messages transmitted in this mode are: 

\code{\textbf{block:}} It consist of block version information, previous block hash, merkle root of a Merkle tree collection which is a hash of all transactions related to this block. Sending  the new block forwarded through all the network.

%\amir{the two parts are uneven regarding how much you discuss}
\paragraphe{Compact Block Propagation:}
From the middle of 2016 in \code{0.13.0} version, Bitcoin protocol start to forward blocks as compact blocks which means instead of forwarding full blocks in network, only a sketch of block is sent. The sketch include 80-byte block's header, the short transactions IDs used for matching already-available transactions and select of transactions which sending peer expect that a receiving peer may be missing. After receiving the compact block, the receiving peer tries to reconstruct the block at its end, from the already received transactions and the one in compact block. In this way the waste of sending each transaction twice is reduced. The advantage of compact block relaying is reducing the spikes in the bandwidth and  also reduce propagation delay. The messages transmitted in this mode are: 

\code{\textbf{sendcmpct:}} This message is introduced in the compact block relaying and it is used to inform the receiving peer about the mode of communication the sending peer has chosen. If the first byte of the message is set to 1 the sender is indicating that it wants to receive blocks as soon as possible and it is working in the high-bandwidth mode. If the first byte of the message is set 0 the sender is saying that it wants to minimize bandwidth usage as much as possible and it is working in the low-bandwidth mode.

\code{\textbf{cmpctblock}:} This message introduced in the compact block relaying and is presenting a sketch of block.

\code{\textbf{getblocktxn}:} This message is introduced in compact block relaying and is used to request for the transactions that are missed by sending a list of their indexes. 

\code{\textbf{blocktxn}:} This message is introduced in compact-block relaying and is used to provide some of the transactions in a block, as requested.


Compact block relaying works in high and low bandwidth settings. In high bandwidth the receiving peer doesn't oblige the sending peers to ask for permission first. So, multiple peers can send the compact block to receiving node. Then at last the sender node sends the missing transactions by \code{blocktxn} message. It is worth mentioning \bc works in high bandwidth mode with up to 3 peers. 
However, in low bandwidth mode, since bandwidth is its bottleneck, the receiving node oblige other nodes to ask for permission first. So, the sender first advertise the block possession by \code{inv} message. Then, the receiving node asks for the compact block by \code{getdata} and the sender will send the compact block by \code{cmpctblock} message. At last, if there is any missing transaction, the receiving node will ask for it by \code{getblocktxn} and the sender will send those transactions via \code{blocktxn}.
